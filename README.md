# README

Rails backend for MissMatched, a fashion app for people with no sense of style. Front end written in React.

Made with:
* ruby 2.6.3p62
* create-react-app
* [React Flickity]('https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-flickity-component')
* Stylized with **Semantic** and **custom CSS**

To get it up and running, fork both this repo, and the [back end repo]('https://github.com/marycriv/closet-app-backend'). In your terminal, "bundle install" and run "rails s" in the backend directory, and run "npm start" in the front end directory. Your backend will be on port 3001, and your front end will be on port 3000.

The majority of fields are pre-populated for demo convenience.
